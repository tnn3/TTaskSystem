Must have functionality:
Users can task CRUD with history.
Users can post tasks that need to be completed.
	-what needs to be done
	-who is doing it (at creation or someone adds later)
	-suggestions on how to do it / describe the problem
	-task priority
	-who to contact and how when task is done
	-paid task or not
	-organisation that ordered task
	-task location
	-task deadline
Users can filter tasks.
Users can see history of tasks.
Users can see others users history.

Nice to have:
Admin can edit task creation template.
Email if new tasks are added.
Email if something changes on tasks.
Task progress %.
